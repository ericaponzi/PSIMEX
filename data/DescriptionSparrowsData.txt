Data for 'The simulation extrapolation technique meets ecology and evolution: A general and intuitive method to account for measurement error'
Ponzi, Keller & Muff, Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2019

This folder contains the phenotypic data for the estimation of inbreeding depression of juvenile survival and heritability of tarsus length. The data come from the long-term song sparrow field study on Mandarte Island, BC, Canada. The data provided here are sufficient to replicate the analyses presented in the above paper, and are therefore a restricted subset of the full Mandarte dataset.
If you are interested in running further analyses that require further data then please get in touch with Prof Lukas Keller (University of Zurich).


Key to variables:

FILE = Sparrows.csv
"id" individual identity of the bird
"gen.father" id of the genetic father (sire from genetic pedigree)
"gen.mother" id of the genetic mother (dam from genetic pedigree)
"social.father" id of the social father (sire from social pedigree)
"social.mother" id of the social mother (dam from social pedigree)
"father" id of the correct father (sire from correct pedigree)
"mother" id of the correct mother (dam from correct pedigree)	
"js" juvenile survival (1 if survived until the end of the first year, 0 otherwise)
"f.corr" correct coefficient of inbreeding
"sex" sex of the bird 
"birth.year" year the bird was born


FILE = Sparrows_morpho.csv
"id" individual identity of the bird
"mintars" tarsus length measure
